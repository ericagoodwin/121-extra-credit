There is an email provided for contributors to report abuse. Commuication in the project's Gitter seems kind and helpful. Many people ask questions and say thank you when their questions are answered. Many users send each other "brownie points" after getting help, which seems to be a point system implemented either through Gitter or the project. Lots of smiley emojis are used which make the Gitter environment seem welcoming. | 2 |
